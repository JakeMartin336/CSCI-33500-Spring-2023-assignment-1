For this project, I tried focusing on the overloading functions, since you get the information needed to created the array from the input.
However, I kept finding issues when compiling, my makefile kept telling me "malloc(): corrupted top size" "aborted: core dumped."
This error kept setting me back at every turn and I tried to figure it out, but was not able to. 
However, I tried to get the cin from the input file, storing it and then reading it character by character.
Then assigning the new array the proper specification based on the input and assigning it to a new Points2D object.
